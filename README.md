Model Used
•	Decision Tree Classifier (Baseline)
•	K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
•	Random Forest Classifier
Conclusions
•	Hyperparameter tuning of random forest takes a long time due to the high number parameters in random forest and the different range of values for each parameter.
•	Tuning the parameter of the model does not improve the model by a big amount, however it is still a small step towards a higher accuracy.
Lesson learn
•	How to use different models for training and prediction
•	
Files and folder descriptions
•	Code
